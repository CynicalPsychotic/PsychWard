# PsychWard

Welcome to my PsychWard my name is Marcus a.k.a. CynicalPsy to the online comunnity. The name CynicalPsy orginated in the good ole days while me and my buddies were playing GTA5 on Xbox360 Online. Dinosaurs were still roamin the earth at that time I believe. I have always been distrusting and sudden movements would leave a fellow teamate or an inncoent A.I. bystander with a bullet in the head, or a stab to the stomach, or a vehicle blown to smitherens, and less not forget the countless sucidies I succesfuly carried out, I mean I wouldnt think twice, that game gave my online persona PTSD. After being kicked out of many lobbies, and ruining the wins for thousands of players, managed to gain a few friends along my path of paranoid destruction. This behavior of mine never dulled down but got worse, until it became down right hilarious. We would laugh at my unnecesary murders, and jumps off of buldings plummeting to my death, and eventually we realised....I am a full blown Psychopath....who trusted no one...and if I felt the slightest suspisious about anyone, id lure them into my car....lock them in...and go on a Willy Wonka style rant unrelated to the game until they would either leave or we met our demise.
